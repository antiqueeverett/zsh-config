# zsh dotfiles

#### Usage
```bash
# first edit the .export file and make sure it
# points to the correct paths as on your systems.

vi .export


# then source the files in this repo from
# your .zshrc

echo "source $PWD/.export" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "source $ANTIGEN_PATH/antigen.zsh" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "source $ZSH_DOTFILES_PATH/.antigenrc" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "source $ZSH_DOTFILES_PATH/.settings" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "source $ZSH_DOTFILES_PATH/.widgets" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "source $ZSH_DOTFILES_PATH/aliases/.aliases" >> ~/.zshrc
```

#### Recommendation
Shamelessly only copy the bits you find useful to you.
