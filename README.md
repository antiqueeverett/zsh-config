#### Usage

###### VERY IMPORTANT:
######   Make sure you update all path variables
######   in zsh-dotfiles/.export to point to the
######   correct paths first. I keep these dotfiles
######   under:

```bash
# todo: update!
$HOME/Repositories/dotfiles/
```

then, in your `.zshrc` simply add:
```bash
source "$HOME/Repositories/dotfiles/zsh-dotfiles/.export"

# install and manage zsh with antigen
source "$ANTIGEN_PATH/antigen.zsh"
source "$ANTIGEN_DOTFILES_PATH/.antigenrc"

# configure zsh
source "$ZSH_DOTFILES_PATH/.settings"
source "$ZSH_DOTFILES_PATH/.widgets"
source "$ZSH_DOTFILES_PATH/aliases/.aliases"

```

Shamelessly copy bits you find useful or worth trying out.
