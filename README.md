# EHM EHM, THANK ME LATER!

#### Usage

1. In your `.zshrc` simply add:
```
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/zsh-dotfiles/.keybinds
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/zsh-dotfiles/.settings
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/zsh-dotfiles/aliases/.aliases
```

I keep all my dotfiles under `$HOME/Repositories/dotfiles/`.
If you have a similar repo naming convention, these dotfiles will work out-of-the-box.
If not, be sure to change the relative paths: ` see step 2`

```
source ~/Repositories/dotfiles/zsh-dotfiles/.keybinds
source ~/Repositories/dotfiles/zsh-dotfiles/.settings
source ~/Repositories/dotfiles/zsh-dotfiles/aliases/.aliases
```

2. in [ aliases/.aliases ](https://github.com/edisonslightbulbs/zsh-dotfiles/blob/master/aliases/.aliases)
```
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/zsh-dotfiles/aliases/.ggit
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/zsh-dotfiles/aliases/.tmux
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/zsh-dotfiles/aliases/.mutt
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/zsh-dotfiles/aliases/.latex
source $HOME/<path-to>/dotfiles/zsh-dotfiles/aliases/.arbitrary
```
Needless to say, as with all dotfiles across the Git galaxy, feel free to cherry-pick whatever may be of some benefit to you. One could also test drive this setup to see some of the as-is GOODNESS!
