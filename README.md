# EHM EHM, THANK ME LATER!

#### Usage

###### IMPORTANT:
Make sure to update all relevant path variables in `zsh-dotfiles/.export` to
point to the correct paths first. I keep these dotfiles under
```bash
vi .export
# update all relavant paths based on your $pwd
```

then, in your `.zshrc` simply add:
```bash
source "$HOME/Repositories/dotfiles/zsh-dotfiles/.export"

# install and manage zsh with antigen
source "$ANTIGEN_PATH/antigen.zsh"
source "$ANTIGEN_DOTFILES_PATH/.antigenrc"

# configure zsh
source "$ZSH_DOTFILES_PATH/.settings"
source "$ZSH_DOTFILES_PATH/.widgets"
source "$ZSH_DOTFILES_PATH/aliases/.aliases"

```

Shamelessly copy bits you find useful or worth trying out.
